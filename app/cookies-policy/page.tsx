                <p>
                    The Aspire application does not use cookies for tracking or advertising purposes. However, some third-party services integrated into the application (notably Supabase and Vercel) may place technical cookies necessary for authentication and hosting to function properly.

                    These cookies are essential for:

                </p>
                <p>
                    - Managing user authentication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Ensuring the stability and security of the service.
                </p>
            </section>

                <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Changes to this policy</h2>
                <p>
                    This policy may be updated if the application evolves or if third parties modify their cookie management.
